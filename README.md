## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first time working with a Figma design file and a style guide. I learned what they are used for and how I can use these in my work as a front-end developer. I took the time to organize my thoughts and think about how I would approach the design.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning how best to utilise flex box in my designs and I also want to learn more about mobile-first design. I also need to improve my entire thought process and organization.
